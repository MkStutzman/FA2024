    <p> dark mode is more than just an aesthetic choice its also a choice for users who may otherwise have visual impedaments. 
        Dark mode works by blackening the background of a website/app while lightening or whitening its elements. 
        For example instagram when switched to dark mode its background becomes black and it elements like the like, share, 
        coment/comments are all changed to white. making the more important elements stand out. </p>
